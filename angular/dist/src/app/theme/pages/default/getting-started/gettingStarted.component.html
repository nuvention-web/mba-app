                            <div class=""><span class="">The Profile page contains a number of questions that would help you get started with your MBA application. These are questions that you will be asked in your application essays and interviews. Brainstorming the answers now and adding them to your profile will allow you to get a head start in the application process. &nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;</span></div>

                            <div class=""><span class="">All schools are interested in why you are applying to their program - use your notes to demonstrate the research you have done about the school and be specific when answering this question.&nbsp;</span></div>

                            <div class=""><strong class="">&nbsp;</strong></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">Your application essays are a very important part of your MBA application. Your GPA and GMAT scores only form part of your application - the essays provide you with an opportunity to differentiate yourself from the thousands of other applicants to the program.&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">myapp.MBA allows you to store all your essay drafts in your portal. If you use myapp.mba&rsquo;s text editor while working on a new essay, you can refer to any of the drafts you have already worked on in a split view. Application essays for different schools have a lot of common themes - referring to essays you have already written while working on a new one will help you share elements between the essays.&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">If you prefer to write your essay in Word, you can upload it to your dashboard. If you do happen to copy parts of an essay you have already written (say for Tuck) to the new essay you are writing (say for Kellogg), myapp.mba will scan the essay to make sure you have not accidentally left any references to Tuck in your Kellogg essay and vice versa.&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">myapp.MBA also provides you with a proof reading service that catches all spelling and grammatical errors - it uses more than 1700 patterns for finding errors and does a more exhaustive job than a Microsoft Word spell check.&nbsp;</span></div>

                            <div class=""><span class="">Once you have uploaded your essay your dashboard - you can send it to any of your friends or family to review, right from the portal itself. They will get an email with your essay and can leave their comments on a personalized portal for them. You will be notified when they have reviewed your essay, and you can view the feedback you received in the portal itself.&nbsp;</span></div>
                            <div class=""><span class="">&nbsp;</span></div>

                            <div class=""><span class="">We will be releasing an &lsquo;export&rsquo; feature in the profile page that will allow you to export all the answers you have worked on to a PDF.
